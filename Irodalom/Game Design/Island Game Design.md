### Campaign
#### Islands
Exploration of a set of randomly generated islands
Limited access to resources during campaign
(the islands get less frequent as you travel further from spawn)
#### Equipment
During the campaign the player can craft equipment with basic resources without cores
#### Calls to battle
As the player explores the islands enemies they kill will have a high likelyhood of dropping a *Kraken's Call*
This when used will mark a spot on the player's map
The marked area contains a boss battle
#### End of campaign
Once the player has killled all the campaign bosses they will face the **Kraken** itself
The player won't be able to defeat the **Kraken**
Instead they receive a task from it to find and kill numerous resource guardians and pinnacle bosses for it
To complete the task they also receive a **portal device** with 4 out of 8 slots unlocked

### Post campaign
#### Game loop
The player uses the **portal device** to open portals to numerous **Distant Archipelago** regions containing multiple randomly generated islands within close proximity
#### Equipment
After the campaign core items for equipment pieces start to drop
These all have a modifier with a randomized numerical value
They may be combined following ruled
- Combination has a relatively high chance to fail turning both cores into resources
- The result of combining is a new core item with all modifiers from the 2 cores used
- If the 2 cores both have a modifier it's numerical value gets increased up to the specified maximum
After a core has been obtained the player uses resources to assemble the equipment piece
These grant the base stats of the equipment piece

#### Distant Archipelagos
All items have an item quantity & difficulty multiplier to archipelagos regions opened using them
If a set of fragments is present the boss will be encountered with other items exclusively serving as difficulty and quantity modifier 
##### Boss occupied regions
Accessed by using a set of **Fragments** in the portal device
Open sea (with a singular island if the boss requires one)
Defeating the boss for the first time will unlock a new portal device slot, as well as dropping the boss' unique **Soul** to be used to access the final showdown against the **Kraken** and the defeated bosses
##### Regular regions
When the portal device is used without a set of boss fragments it takes the player to a regular archipelago
It generates a number of islands with a selected resource for each of them
The resource selection is weighted equally towards all resource types except for the ones used to open the portal which gain additional weighting
These resource islands can also transform into a guardian encounter dropping a boss **Fragment** of the appropriate boss and tier
